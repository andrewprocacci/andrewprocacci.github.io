Hi! My name is Andrew Procacci. I was born and raised in the greater Philadelphia area. I graduated from Temple University with a B.S. in Information Science and Technology. I am an application developer at Qurate Retail Group in West Chester, PA.

I am also an active real estate investor. My father sparked my interest in real estate after I watched him flip a neighbor's run-down house into a beautiful rental property. I am primarily interested in purchasing smaller properties (single family homes, duplexes, etc.) with the hopes of flipping houses later on in my real estate journey.

Let's make a deal!
